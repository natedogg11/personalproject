<h1>4. Investing in your Stocks.</h1>
<p1>The key ideas to understand before you begin are listed below:
    <ul class="b">
        <li>Increase portfolio diversity.</li>
        <li>Invest only in companies you fully comprehend.</li>
        <li>Till you master investing, stay away from stocks with significant instability.</li>
        <li>Don't invest in penny stocks at all costs.</li>
        <li>Learn the fundamental ideas and parameters for stock evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
</p1>
<p1>
    Learn some of the fundamental methods for assessing particular stocks if you want to invest in them.
     Learning about diversity, or the idea that your portfolio should include a range of different types of companies, is a smart idea.
      I would, however, advise against over-diversification. 
      Stay with companies you are familiar with, and if you find that you are proficient in appraising a specific class of stock, there is nothing wrong with having a sizable portion of your portfolio invested in a specific sector.
