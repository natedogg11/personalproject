<h1>2. Deciding how much you are Investing.</h1>
<h2>50/30/20</h2>
<p1>The 50/30/20 budgeting technique, which divides your monthly budget into three categoriesâ€”needs (50%), wants (30%), and the remaining 20% for debt repayment, savings, and investments.
     If saving a part of the 20% of your pay seems that it might be too much for your budget to bear, you might want to start with a fixed amount of money to invest and stick to it. 
    If you use the appropriate investment strategy, you could be able to see a return on your money with investing only a few dollars per month.</p1>
