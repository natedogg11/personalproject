    <h1>3. Opening an Account.</h1>
    <p1>Now you need to open a brokerage account. 
        You can do this with companies E Trade, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and many others.
         There are two main types of accounts you can open, a standard brokerage account and an individual retirement account (a.k.a. an IRA).
         You are able to purchase stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs using either kind of account.
          The primary factors to take into account here are your investment objectives and how simple you wish it to be to access your funds.</p1>
    <h2>Standard Brokerage Account</h2>
    <p1>A standard brokerage account is likely what you're looking for if you want quick access to your funds or wish to invest above the yearly IRA contribution maximum.</p1>
    <h2>Individual Retirement Account</h2>
    <p1>An IRA is an excellent option if you want to start saving for retirement. 
        Traditional and Roth IRAs, these are two basic types of accounts, as well as a few specific IRAs for self-employed people and small business owners, such as the SEP IRA and SIMPLE IRA.
         Although IRAs offer excellent tax advantages for stock purchases, it may be challenging to access your funds until you reach retirement age.</p1>
