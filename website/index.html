<h2>Investing in Stocks?</h2>
<p1>A stock, usually referred to as equity, is a type of investment which denotes possession in a portion of the listed company.
    Shares, also known as units of stock, empower their owners to a portion of the company's assets and income in relation to the number of shares they possess.
    Most individual investors' portfolios are built on stocks, which are mostly sold and purchased on stock exchanges.</p1>
