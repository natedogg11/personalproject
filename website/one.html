    <h1>1. Deciding on how you are Investing.</h1>
<h2>Possible options are investing on your own.</h2>
<p1>
    If you've got the opportunity and motivation to fully investigate and assess stocks on a regular basis, I'll advise you to invest on your own.
     A wise and persistent investor has a good chance of outperforming the market in the long run. 
     On the other hand, there really is nothing wrong in adopting a more passive strategy if things like quarterly earnings reports and mathematical mathematical calculations aren't your strong suit.

<h2>Have someone manage investments for you.</h2>
<p1>
    A computerized system known as a "robo-advisor" offers automatic, algorithm-driven financial planning and investing operations with minimal to no human oversight.
     A standard robo-advisor will carry out a questionnaire to learn more about your economic position and objectives.
      The data is then used to provide advice and carry out automated investing on your behalf.
       Easy account setup, thorough objective planning, account services, and portfolio management are all features of the top robo-advisors.
        They also provide low prices, extensive education, and security measures.

<h2>Investing in Index funds and Mutual funds.</h2>
<p1>
    Index funds are simply replicating a specific index, index investors aren't required to constantly monitor their stocks and bonds investments as attentively.
     This is what distinguishes index funds from mutual funds and is the reason they are referred to as passive investment. 
     For instance, the S&P 500 fund is the stocks of roughly 500 top companies based in America.

With a mutual fund, money is gathered from numerous individuals and is pooled together to invest in a variety of assets, such as bonds, stocks, and/or money market investments.
The assets of mutual funds are supervised and handled by fund managers, who work to maximize returns for investors.
